# Apocalipsum
## How to install:
You need to have python installed, it has been tested on python versions 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9

Next up you'll need pygame (we used 2.0.1)
This can be done using `python -m pip install pygame==2.0.1 --user` (on some systems you might need to use `python3` instead of `python`)

## How to run
From the root folder of the project (the one containing main, audio and entities), run `python -m main.main` (on some systems you might need to use `python3` instead of `python`)

## Highscores
